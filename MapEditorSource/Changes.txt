- Layer 3 has been removed. It is now used as a rain layer which the game 
  uses when it rains. Rain is placed automatically on the map.

- Now possible to place a GRH randomly on map. Select what GRH to place, and then
  how many of the GRH to place on map. Then click PLACE RANDOM GRH and the GRH`S
  will be placed randomly around the map.

- You can now place NPC`s around on the map randomly. Select what NPC to place randomly,
  then click PLACE NPC RANDOMLY. For each time you click it, one more NPC of selected
  kind will be placed somewhere on the map.

- You can now block GRH`s on the map quite simple ! Just type in what GRH to block, and
  then select to block all GRH`S of that kind on maps. Great for trees and other obstacles
  which you forgot to place blocked on.

- Two different brush sizes ! Small and big ! Small paints only one tile, big paints
  a even bigger area !

- 4 different scroll speeds ! Normal, Medium, Fast & Ultra Fast ! Please note that
  your character may seem to be jumpy when switching to speeds over MEDIUM. You may
  not notice the differece between Fast and Ultra Fast. That depends on your machine.
  
- More possibilities when clearing map ! You can now clear the different borders 
  as you want in the OPTIONS menu. Just choose what GRH to clear with and then
  clear whatever you want ! Great for coastlines and such.

- Erasing layers now works fine.
