SYSTEM FILES PROBLEMS

If you ever get any errors which say a file isnt registered, a file
is out of date or a file is missing, please do this:

#1. Find the file in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and delete it.
    If the system sais that it cannot be deleted, go out in DOS
    and delete it there. If the file was not there, skip #1.

#2. Place the file with the same name FROM the Era Online directory 
    into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

#3. Select RUN on your windows START menu and type in:
    REGSVR32 and then the name of the file. For example:
    REGSVR32 Oleaut32.dll

#4. Restart machine.

The problem should now be fixed. If the system tells you another file
isnt registered or is out of date, do the same with that file until 
the problems goes away
